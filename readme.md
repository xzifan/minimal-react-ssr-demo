# Minimal react-SSR demo 
This is demo for learning SSR. In this demo, we are planning to build a minimal web application to demonstrate the pros and cons of SSR for a web application. 

## What's SSR

## How does the demo work?
First of all, it is a react app. We run and build it with webpack.  
0. Make sure you have node 14.x installed
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
2. Use the npm scripts we have configured to run locally `npm run dev` or make a production build to '/dist' `npm run build`

For the web application:
...

For the server side rendering:
...
### node version
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
2. Use the npm scripts we have configured to run locally `npm run dev-all` to run in parallel the build script and all scripts that start with `dev:*` - including `dev:build-server` and `dev:start`.
3. Now, open http://localhost:3001/ in your web browser and you will see your server-side rendered app.
